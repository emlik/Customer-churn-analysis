# Customer-churn-analysis

Churn prediction consists of detecting which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a service based on how they use the service. We want to predict the answer to the following question: “Is this customer going to leave us within the next X months?” There are only two possible answers, yes or no; a binary classification task.
Why it matters?

Numpy, Pandas, Keras(TensorFlow as backend)

Businesses often have to invest substantial amounts attracting new clients, so every time a client leaves it represents a significant investment lost. Both time and effort then need to be channelled into replacing them. Being able to predict when a client is likely to leave and offer them incentives to stay can offer huge savings to a business.
What is the main challenge?

Once we have our initial results / predictions, the next stage would be to iterate over the steps (cleaning the data, feature selection, modelling, etc.) in an effort to boost the accuracy (or whatever scoring metric you use) of our model. The addition or removal of features, the tuning of hyper parameters, or simply the use of a more complete or larger dataset may all boost our model.

Libraries used:

    Numpy
    
    NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
    a powerful N-dimensional array object
    sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
    tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
    useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

    Pandas
    pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis                 tools for the Python programming language.

    Tensorflow

    Another numerical computation library that runs very fast computations that can run on your CPU or GPU
    Google Brain, Apache 2.0 license
    Theano & Tensorflow are used primarily for research and development in the deep learning field
    Deep Learning neural network from scratch, use the above
    Great for inventing new deep learning neural networks, deep learning models, lots of line of code

    Keras

    Wrapper for Theano + Tensorflow
    Amazing library to build deep neural networks in a few lines of code
    Very powerful deep neural networks in few lines of code
    based on Theano and Tensorflow
    Sci-kit Learn (Machine Learning models), Keras (Deep Learning models)



    $ pip install tensorflow
    $ pip install keras
    $ conda update --all
